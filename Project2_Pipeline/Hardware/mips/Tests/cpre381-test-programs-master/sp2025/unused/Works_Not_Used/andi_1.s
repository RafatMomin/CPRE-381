#Start Tests: This test will make sure that the andi instruction can preserve the bottom half a register
# The main point of this is to check that the andi operation works in the ALU and all registers are hooked up correctly
#this test only makes use of 3 instructions, addi, lui, and andi, making sure that as few false errors are thrown.

    # Initilalize registers to all 1's
